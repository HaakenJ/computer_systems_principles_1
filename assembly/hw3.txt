# This program prompts a user for input
# and continues to do so as long as the user
# does not enter a negative number.  Once they
# do, the program outputs the highest number
# that was inputted.

# r1 - input from user
# r2 - current maximum
# r3 - temporary storage

# initialize max to 0
addi r2 r0 0

# start loop and get input
loop: in r1

# if input is greater than 0 or equal to 0
# go to testMax
    bgz r1 &testMax
    bez r1 &testMax    

# else, input is negative
# print out max
    out r2
    .halt

# subtract max from input
# if result is greater than 0 set the 
# input value to the max register and
# return to loop
testMax: sub r3 r1 r2
    bgz r3 &setMax
    bez r0 &loop    

# set the input value to the max register
# return to the loop
setMax: addi r2 r1 0
    bez r0 &loop
